# Workflow

1. User Interaction
User taps the floating action button to start/stop listening.
Speech-to-Text API converts speech to text.

2. Processing Request
The text input is sent to OpenAI API for generating responses or images.

3. Generating Response
The response from OpenAI API is either a text or an image URL.
Text-to-Speech API converts the text response to speech.

4. Delivering Response
The generated text or image is displayed in the UI.
The spoken response is played back to the user if it is text.

**This setup ensures a seamless integration of voice interaction, OpenAI's powerful language and image generation capabilities, and a responsive, animated UI to provide a rich user experience.**
